for those who use my themes found here or the one theme i still have left on pastebin, i've finally found a fix to the ask box problem. 
when you click on ask on the dash it will take you to the /ask page but the ask box is just a sliver of itself. this will fix that problem and allow those who want
to send you asks from the dash to do so.

this code needs to go in the css of your theme. i've been putting it above the cursor code, but it should work no matter where you put it. should you have any
questions feel free to throw them in my inbox!

iframe#ask_form { 
      width: 455px;
      height: 230px;
      min-height: 220px; 
      }
