# public-themes
themes available to the public as posted on houseofsol. these themes are available for your personal use. please do not use these in theme giveaways or in commercial projects.

when using these themes please make sure that you have "open links in new windows" or "open links in new tabs" turned off. if not you'll find all the links opening up in new windows or tabs instead of the main one like it's supposed to. also make sure that the same settings are turned off in xkit. otherwise the same thing will happen; these themes won't work the way they were meant to.

these themes are coded to work best in chrome. they do work in firefox, but they don't look as good as if they were used in chrome.
